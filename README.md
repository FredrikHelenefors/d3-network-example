# d3js Force-Directed Graph

A d3js graph based on [Mike Bostock’s force-directed graph](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045) implemented in AngularJS 1.5 project.

> This simple force-directed graph shows character co-occurence in Les Misérables. A physical simulation of charged particles and springs places related characters in closer proximity, while unrelated characters are farther apart. Layout algorithm inspired by [Tim Dwyer](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~tdwyer/) and [Thomas Jakobsen](http://web.archive.org/web/20080410171619/http://www.teknikus.dk/tj/gdc2001.htm). Data based on character coappearence in Victor Hugo's Les Misérables, compiled by [Donald Knuth](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/sgb.html).
